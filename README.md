## Overview

Conducted exploratory data analysis on SpaceX's launch and inventory data. The analysis led to insights on SpaceX's launch patterns, rocket performance, the payload requirements of its customer base, and its major clientele. 

A personal project to practice working with multiple datasets at once and to exercise data wrangling and munging skills. Morever, the project was inspired by a curiosity about SpaceX as a company and was an attempt to understand its business model and track the growth in its operations over the years.
